    intro: 'Woodstock is evolving its curriculum from the International Baccalaureate programme to a combination of Cambridge IGCSE, Advanced Placement, and the Woodstock School Diploma. This change is gradual — your child\'s pathway depends entirely on their current grade. This guide answers the questions we heard most often at Parent-Teacher Conferences.',

    directAnswer: 'Yes — if your child is happy and learning.

Most importantly: if your child is currently in Grades 9–12, they complete IB as planned. Zero change for them.',
